# Things I want this workflow to do:
  # run on dispatch
  # do i have any inputs?
  # checkout
  # create a python venv
  # activate
  # download dependencies
  # run tests and exit on failure
  # build the app locally and exit on failure
  # create a docker image of the app for co-pilot
    # may include build pipeline like from hard2heat
  # use aws co-pilot to deploy app, provisions everything for use, nice and easy to use hopefully
    # need to know aws role to assume
    # make sure github has permissions to access aws resources
    # use image that will hopefully have been created above
    # exit on failure
    # provide url on success
